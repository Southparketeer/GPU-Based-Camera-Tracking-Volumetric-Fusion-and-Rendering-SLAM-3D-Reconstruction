# SLAM Large Dense Scene Real Time 3D Reconstruction
GPU based camera tracking volumetric fusion and rendering.

* __Camera Tracking__: Track camera poses in real-time by registering incoming depth image to the generated depth from fused TSDF. 

* __Volumetric Fusion__: With the updated camera pose, fuse the new income depth to the fused TSDF volume in real-time. 

* __Volumetric Rendering__: Render the fused TSDF volume in real-time.
