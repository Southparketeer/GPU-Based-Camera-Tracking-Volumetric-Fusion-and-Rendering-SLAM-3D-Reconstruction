# SLAM Large Dense Scene Real-time 3D Reconstruction
GPU based camera tracking volumetric fusion and rendering.
* Camera Tracking: Track camera poses in real-time by registering incoming depth image to the generated depth from fused TSDF. 
* Volumetric Fusion: With the updated camera pose, fuse the new income depth to the fused TSDF volume in real-time. 
* Volumetric Rendering: Render the fused TSDF volume in real-time.
